Approach:
The goal of this project was to build a chatbot using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. The chatbot is designed to receive user questions as input and provide personalized answers based on the knowledge provided in a given document. The implementation involves two main phases: Retrieval and Generation.

In the Retrieval phase, the chatbot employs basic string matching to find relevant context from the knowledge document that matches the user's question. Although the actual implementation would use more sophisticated retrieval methods like TF-IDF, BM25, or Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), this simplified approach allows us to demonstrate the core concept.

The Generation phase utilizes a Language Model (LLM) orchestrator (e.g., Langchain) to generate personalized answers based on the retrieved context. In this simplified implementation, we used a text generation pipeline from the transformers library as a placeholder for the LLM orchestrator.

Assumptions:

For simplicity, the knowledge document is provided as a static string variable. In a real-world scenario, the document would be sourced from a database or external source, and the chatbot would retrieve it as needed.
The current implementation uses basic string matching for context retrieval, which may not be the most efficient method. The assumption is that more sophisticated retrieval methods will be used to improve accuracy and efficiency in the actual implementation.
The LLM orchestrator (e.g., Langchain) is assumed to be available and properly integrated into the chatbot. The placeholder pipeline used for text generation will be replaced with the actual orchestrator code for the complete solution.
Future Scope:
The current implementation serves as a basic foundation for a more comprehensive chatbot using RAG. The future scope of the project includes the following enhancements and additional features:

Improved Retrieval Methods: Implement advanced retrieval techniques like TF-IDF, BM25, or Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to find highly relevant context from the knowledge document.

Integration with LLM Orchestrator: Integrate the chatbot with a suitable LLM orchestrator (e.g., Langchain) to achieve more accurate and contextually relevant answers. Fine-tune the language model using the RAG framework for seamless integration.

Evaluation Metrics: Develop evaluation metrics to assess the relevance and quality of the generated answers. This can be achieved by creating synthetic data with labeled responses and using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or METEOR to evaluate the model's performance.

Multi-linguality Support: Enhance the chatbot to support multiple languages, enabling users to ask questions and receive answers in their preferred language.

Speech Capabilities: Introduce speech capabilities, enabling users to interact with the chatbot using voice input and receive responses in voice format.

User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for the chatbot, making it accessible to users across different platforms and devices.

Real-time Updates: Implement mechanisms to ensure that the chatbot stays up-to-date with the latest knowledge and information.

Handling Ambiguity: Enhance the chatbot's ability to handle ambiguous questions and provide clarifications when necessary.

In conclusion, the implemented chatbot provides a basic structure for a Retrieval Augmented Generation system. With further development and enhancements, the chatbot can become a powerful tool for providing personalized and contextually relevant answers to user questions based on the available knowledge document. The future scope opens up exciting opportunities to enhance user experience, support multiple languages, and enable more natural interactions with the chatbot.
